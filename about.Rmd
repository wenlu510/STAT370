## *2014 Homeicide and Shooting*

We will explore the Homeicide and Shooting crimes at the city of Baltimore during the year of 2014.

```{r include=FALSE}
source('Homework2.R')
```

### Data Display

First we can look at the different variables the data contains

```{r,echo=FALSE}
head(Crime)
```

It has 11 different variables, and most of them are categorical. 

### Exploratory Data

In order to get a general idea of the data, we can plot them into graphs. 

```{r,echo=FALSE}
barplot(prop.table(table(D1)))
```

Based on the bargraph about 32% of the crimes are Homicide, and about 68% of the crimes are Shootings. 

```{r,echo=FALSE}
barplot(prop.table(table(D2)),las=2)
```
```{r,echo=FALSE}
dotchart(table(D2))
```

It seems like most of the crimes occurs at Western, Southwestern, Northwestern, and Northeastern part of the city. So if I were a resident who lives at the city of Balitimore, I will be careful around these neighboorhoods.
